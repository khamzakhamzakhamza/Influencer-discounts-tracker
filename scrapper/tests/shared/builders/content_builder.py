There are at least 160 statewide ballot measures across 41 states in the 2024 United States elections.

11 of these measures are related to abortion, a record amount for a single year. Ten ballot measures would create state constitutional rights to have an abortion. In Nebraska, a ballot measure would limit the ability to have an abortion.

6 of these measures ban voting for people who arenâ€™t American citizens. By the way, thereâ€™s already a voting ban on noncitizens for federal elections. 

5 of these measures would implement ranked choice voting. One would get rid of ranked choice voting in Alaska. Another would prevent ranked choice from ever happening in Missouri. 

4 raise the minimum wage. 3 legalize marijuana, including notably in Florida. Massachusetts could become the third state to legalize psychedelics. 

Thereâ€™s a lot more to vote for than just the president.
